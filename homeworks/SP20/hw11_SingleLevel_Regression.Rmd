Please respond to the questions below. I encourage you to collaborate with your classmates, but you must submit your own work. This assignment is due on the date listed above. **If you use `R`, please run `set.seed(04242020)` at the top your script**. This will make the simulations reproducible. If using `knitr` (`.Rmd` file), place the following at the top of the script:

```{r setup, include=TRUE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(cache=TRUE, autodep=TRUE, cache.comments=TRUE)
set.seed(04242020)
```
