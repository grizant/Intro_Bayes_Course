## Start-of-class work: Please prepare your workspace

Scratch paper, handheld calculator, pencils with eraser, 1 page of notes, etc.

## Midterm One

- You may begin working as soon as you get your exam.  
- I'll project a timer counting down. All exams must be turned in promptly.
- Please keep all cell phones/laptops/other communication devices away until all exams are turned in. If not, you have violated the student conduct code.  
- You may ask for clarification on any question. But I cannot intrepret the question or give hints.  
- If you finish early, then please submit your work and you may leave quietly.
