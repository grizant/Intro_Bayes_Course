## Organization

- The purpose is to discuss the projects and get feedback in time to make adjustments.
- No one is judging or grading you. This is supposed to be fun and educational.
- I will give you a participation grade for showing up prepared.
- To organize, I'll randomly select students to present for a few minutes. Take turns sharing/discussing your work.
- I'll bring everyone back together for general comments and closing.

## Summary and closing
