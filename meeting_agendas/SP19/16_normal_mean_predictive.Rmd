## Guest lecture by Professor Yinghan Chen

## Main points:

- The predictive distribution of the next observation is normal(m', (s')2) where the mean m' = mn, the posterior mean, and , the observation variance plus the posterior variance. (The posterior variance  allows for the uncertainty in estimating μ.) The predictive distribution is found by marginalizing μ out of the joint distribution f(yn+1, μ|y1, ..., yn).
