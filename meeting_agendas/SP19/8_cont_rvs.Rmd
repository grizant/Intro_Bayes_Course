## I. Start-of-class work: Exploring continuous random variables (5 - 10 min)

Discuss and prepare to share your thoughts on:

1. Why do we call P(X = x) a probability *density* function for a continuous random variable?
2. Why is P(X = x) = 0 for any continuous random variable X?
3. What does $\Gamma(\cdot)$ denote?

## II. Continuous random variables (10 - 20 min)

When our random variable can take on any value in a interval, we need to redefine the probability function and use more sophificated mathematical notions.

### Probability density function

Let's walk through Bolstad's "Thought Experiment 4" to motivate the concept of a pdf on the doc cam.

### The mean, variance of a cont. rvs.

$E[Y]= \int_{-\infty}^\infty y f(y) dy$  

$Var[Y] = \int_{-\infty}^\infty (y - \mu)^2 f(y) dy$.

Bolstad motivates these quantities as the limit of the sample mean as $n \rightarrow \infty$.

### Overview of common conts rvs. 

- Uniform (standard)
- Beta
- Gamma
- Normal

Recall the CLT (Central Limit Theorem):

For $n \geq 25$, 

$$\frac{\bar{y} - \mu}{\sigma / \sqrt{n}} \approx normal(0,1)$$  

for **any** continuous random variable, $Y$. What this means is the sums of indendepent rvs become normally distributed. This powerful fact is why the normal distribution is so useful and common.

### Joint cont rvs

Let's inspect/discuss Figures 7.10 and 7.11

## III. Application: Jigsaw of HW 4 problems

Learning outcome 3: Students will model parameters and data using discrete and continuous random variables.

### Work your assigned problem: Ch.7, #1,3-5,8,9,12 in Bolstad & Curran (10 min)

If you give done with your assigned problem, please work the other exercises and help each other.

### A randomly select a member from each group shares their solution (30 min)

## IV. Project discussion (10 min)

Let's discuss [Intro-to-Bayesian-Statistics_project_organization.pdf](https://github.com/grizant/Intro_Bayes_Course/blob/develop/course_materials/Intro-to-Bayesian-Statistics_project_organization.pdf).
