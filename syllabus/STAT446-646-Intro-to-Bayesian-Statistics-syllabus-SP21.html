<h2>Course Description</h2>
<p>This course introduces Bayesian statistics to a technical audience. Early on, we focus on the logic behind Bayesian statistics, including the mathematical formalization of updating beliefs under uncertainty. Then we describe Bayesian methods for well-known probability models and compare these methods to classical (frequentist) alternatives. Topics include Bayes’ Theorem, prior specification, Bayesian inference for discrete and continuous univariate random variables, and linear regression. We’ll implement methods analytically and using software such as Minitab, <code>R</code>, and <code>Stan</code>.</p>
<p><em>Instructor’s role</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Help explain and guide student understanding and skill development.</li>
<li>Organize the course structure and assignments.</li>

<h1>Attendance</h1>
<p>Students are expected to attend class. If important circumstances prevent this, it is the student’s responsibility to find out what was covered in class, what was assigned for reading or homework, and what special announcements (if any) were made. “Excessive absence” in this class will be construed to be absence from more than 10 percent of the scheduled class sessions, whether excused or unexcused.</p>
</div>
<div id="assignments" class="section level1">
<h1>Assignments</h1>
<div id="problem-sets" class="section level2">

<h2>Makeup, Late Policy</h2>
<ul>
<li>Completed problem sets exams are due on Fridays.</li>

<li>Exceptions will be made when a student misses work due to a documented (doctor’s note) illness or an extraordinary situation (up to the discretion of the instructor).</li>
<li>There will be no early or make-up exams.</li>
<li>If you need to miss an exam due to participation in a religious holiday or an official university activities (including athletics and other sanctioned activities), please make arrangements with the instructor at least two weeks prior to the exam in question.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>I’ll drop (trim) your 2 lowest grades in the “Problem Set” category to protect against 1-2 outlying points having too much weight (e.g., a 0).</strong></p>

<div id="grading" class="section level1">
<h1>Grading</h1>
<p>The course has a weighted grading scheme. There are three categories of assignments for 446 students. Table 1 shows the percentages for each category and the number of assignments (n). Table 2 gives the similar table for 646 students with the addition of a “Project” category. Table 3 displays the percentage thresholds determining the final overall letter grade.</p>

This includes the classroom, laboratory, studio, creative space, or any type of in-person instructional activity, and public spaces.</p>
<p>A “face covering” is defined as a “covering that fully covers a person’s nose and mouth, including without limitation, cloth face mask, surgical mask, towels, scarves, and bandanas” (State of Nevada Emergency Directive 024).</p>

<h2>Statement on COVID-19 Social Distancing:</h2>
<p>Face coverings are not a substitute for social distancing. Students shall observe current social distancing guidelines where possible in accordance with the Phase we are in while in the classroom, laboratory, studio, creative space (hereafter referred to as instructional space) setting and in public spaces. Students should avoid congregating around instructional space entrances before or after class sessions. If the instructional space has designated entrance and exit doors students are required to use them. Students should exit the instructional space immediately after the end of instruction to help ensure social distancing and allow for the persons attending the next scheduled class session to enter.</p>
