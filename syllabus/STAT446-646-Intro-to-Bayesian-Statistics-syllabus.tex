\noindent This course introduces Bayesian statistics to a technical audience. Early on, we focus on the logic behind Bayesian statistics, including the mathematical formalization of updating beliefs under uncertainty. Then we describe Bayesian methods for well-known probability models and compare these methods to classical (frequentist) alternatives. Topics include Bayes' Theorem, prior specification, Bayesian inference for discrete and continuous univariate random variables, and linear regression. We'll implement methods analytically and using software such as Minitab, R, and Stan.

The latter portions of the course focus on implementing more advanced Bayesian methods through modern computational techniques to sample posterior distributions including Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) and Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC). The aim will be to provide the concepts and technical skills to conduct a realistic Bayesian data analysis. 

\section*{Catalog Description}
Statistical inference using Bayes' Theorem. Topics include posterior analysis for continuous and discrete random variables, prior specification, Bayesian regression, multivariate inference, and posterior sampling through Markov Chain Monte Carlo.

\section*{Course Pre-requisites}
STAT 352 or STAT 467/667 or with instructor approval. STAT 445/645 is a suggested preparation.

\section*{400-level Student Learning Outcomes}
\begin{description}
\item[UG1] Students will be able to demonstrate understanding of the concepts that underlie Bayesian inference and compare the results to frequentist alternatives.
\item[UG2] Students will be able to conduct Bayesian inference analytically and interpret the results.
\item[UG3] Students will be able to perform a Bayesian analysis using professional statistical packages (e.g., \textsf{Minitab}, \textsf{R}, and \textsf{Stan}).
\end{description}

\section*{600-level Student Learning Outcomes}
In addition to the above 400-level outcomes, graduate students will:
\begin{description}
\item[GRAD1] Students will be able to synthesize course concepts to apply Bayesian modeling techniques to real-world data in the pursuit of scientific inquiry.

\section*{Assignments}
Exercises will be assigned approximately weekly. You are encouraged to discuss assignments between each other and with instructor. However, the assignment must be completed and submitted individually. 

\section*{Midterms}
There will be three midterms, the first on Wednesday, February 5, the second on Wednesday, March 11, and the third on Wednesday, April 8.

\section*{Final exam}
Due to the computational complexity involved in latter topics, the final exam will be take home.

\section*{Exam policy} You will be allowed at one 8.5x11in page of handwritten (on both sides) notes for the first midterm. And one additional page of notes for each following midterm (three total pages). If you believe that your grade for exam or assignment is incorrect, contact instructor at the office hours with a rational justification. All such requests must be submitted to instructor within one week after a grade is announced; late requests will not be granted. Please understand that everyone can make a mistake, and that mistakes can go both ways: higher or lower than original grade.

\section*{400/600 Students}
As indicated above, the student learning outcomes differ at the 400 and 600 levels. 600-level students must complete a \textbf{term project} in addition to all 400-level requirements.

\section*{Makeup, Late Policy}
Late assignments, exams, and projects will be graded with a 5 point (out of 20) penalty per day. Exceptions will be made when a student misses work due to a documented (doctor's note) illness or an extraordinary situation (up to the discretion of the instructor). There will be no early or make-up exams. However, if you need to miss an exam due to participation in a religious holiday or an official university activities (including athletics and other sanctioned activities), you must make arrangements with the instructor at least two weeks prior to the exam in question. \textbf{I'll drop your lowest grade in the ``Assignments'' category to give a more realistic description of your performance, if you aren't able to finish all assignment on time.}

\section*{Grading}

We'll use a point system to evaluate student learning. There are four categories of assignments. Table \ref{tab:points} shows the total points possible within each category before dropping any low scores.

\begin{table}[h]
  \begin{center}
  \begin{tabular}{l|c|c}	%For grade items (quizzes, homework, etc.)
Item&400-level& 600-level\\\hline\hline
  Assignments& 300 & 300\\
  Midterm Exams& 150 & 150\\
  Final Exam& 150 & 150\\
  Term project &-- & 150 \\
  \end{tabular}
  \caption{Total points available within each assignment category (ignoring any extra credit). \label{tab:points}}
\end{center}

\end{table}

The sum of all points earned determine the final letter grades, according to the thresholds listed in Table \ref{tab:grade}.

\begin{table}[h]
\begin{center}
  \begin{tabular}{r|l|l}
    Letter grade &400-level& 600-level\\\hline\hline
    A ($\geq 92\%$)&534 or above&672 or above\\
    A- ($\geq 90\%$)&522 to 533&657 to 671\\
    B+ ($\geq 88\%$)&511 to 521&643 to 656\\
    B ($\geq 82\%$)&476 to 510&599 to 642\\
    B- ($\geq 80\%$)&464 to 475&584 to 598\\
    C+ ($\geq 78\%$)&453 to 463&570 to 583\\
    C ($\geq 72\%$)&418 to 452&526 to 569\\
    C- ($\geq 70\%$)&407 to 417&511 to 525\\
    D+ ($\geq 68\%$)&395 to 406&497 to 510\\
    D ($\geq 62\%$)&360 to 394&453 to 496\\
    D- ($\geq 60\%$)&348 to 359&439 to 452\\
    F ($< 60\%$)&347 or below&438 or below
  \end{tabular}
  \caption{Conversion table between points and letter grades, after dropping the lowest ``Assignments'' grade (20 points dropped).\label{tab:grade}}
\end{center}

\end{table}

The instructor reserves the right to deviate from the above thresholds, including assigning $+$ or $-$.
